        The FHIR terminology specification is based two key concepts, originally defined in HL7 v3 Core Principles :

        * code system - defines a set of codes with meanings (also known as enumeration, terminology, classification, and/or ontology)
        * value set - selects a set of codes from those defined by one or more code systems

        **Scope and Usage**

        The FHIR terminology specification is based two key concepts, originally defined in HL7 v3 Core Principles : 
        
        * CodeSystem - defines a set of codes with meanings (also known as enumeration, terminology, classification, and/or ontology) - e.g. define which codes (symbols and/or expressions) exist, and how they are understood
        * ValueSet - selects a set of codes from those defined by one or more code systems to specify which codes can be used in a particular context
