        An interaction between a patient and healthcare provider(s) for the purpose of providing healthcare service(s)

        **Scope and Usage**

        A patient encounter is further characterized by the setting in which it takes place. 
        Amongst them are ambulatory, emergency, home health, inpatient and virtual encounters. 
        An Encounter encompasses the lifecycle from pre-admission, the actual encounter (for ambulatory encounters), 
        and admission, stay and discharge (for inpatient encounters).

        During the encounter the patient may move from practitioner to practitioner and location to location.
