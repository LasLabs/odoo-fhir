        Prospective warnings of potential issues when providing care to the patient.

        **Scope and Usage**

        A flag is a warning or notification of some sort presented to the user - who may be a clinician or some other person involve in patient care. It usually represents something of sufficient significance to be warrant a special display of some sort - rather than just a note in the resource. A flag has a subject representing the resource that will trigger its display. This subject can be of different types, as described in the examples below:

        * A note that a patient has an overdue account, which the provider may wish to discuss with them - in case of hardship for example (subject = Patient)
        * An outbreak of Ebola in a particular region (subject=Location) so that all patients from that region have a higher risk of having that condition
        * A particular provider is unavailable for referrals over a given period (subject = Practitioner)
        * A patient who is enrolled in a clinical trial (subject=Group)
        * Special guidance or caveats to be aware of when following a protocol (subject=PlanDefinition)
        * Warnings about using a drug in a formulary requires special approval (subject=Medication)
