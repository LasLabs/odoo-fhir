    'description': """
        This resource allows for the definition of various types of plans as a sharable, consumable, and executable artifact. 
        The resource is general enough to support the description of a broad range of clinical artifacts such as clinical decision support rules, order sets and protocols. 

        **Scope and Usage** 

        A plan definition is a pre-defined group of actions to be taken in particular circumstances, often including conditions, options, and other decision points. 

        The resource is flexible enough to be used to represent a variety of clinical decision support and quality improvement assets, including order sets, protocols, and decision support rules.
