        DICOM imaging study content

    'description': """
        Representation of the content produced in a DICOM imaging study. A study comprises a set of series, 
        each of which includes a set of Service-Object Pair Instances (SOP Instances - images or other data) acquired or 
        produced in a common context. A series is of only one modality (e.g. X-ray, CT, MR, ultrasound), but a study may have multiple series of different modalities.

        **Scope and Usage**

        ImagingStudy provides information on a DICOM imaging study, and the series and imaging objects in that study. It also provides information on how to retrieve that information (in a native DICOM format, or in a rendered format, such as JPEG). ImagingStudy is used to make available information about all parts of a single DICOM study.
