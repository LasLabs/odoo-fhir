        The Care Team resource includes all the people and/or organizations who plan to participate in the coordination 
        and delivery of care for a patient. This is not limited to practitioners, but may include other caregivers such as 
        family members, guardians, the patient themself, or others. The Care Team, depending on where used, may include 
        care team members specific to a particular care plan, an episode, an encounter, or may reflect all known team members 
        across these perspectives.
