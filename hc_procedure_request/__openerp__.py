        A request for a procedure to be performed. May be a proposal or an order.

        **Scope and Usage** 
        
        A Procedure Request is a record of a request for a procedure to be performed. 
        It can be used to represent a procedure that is planned, that is proposed, or that is ordered, 
        as distinguished by the value of the ProcedureRequestStatus field.

        A procedure is an activity that is performed with or on a patient as part of the provision of care. 
        Examples include surgical procedures, diagnostic procedures, endoscopic procedures, biopsies, counseling, 
        physiotherapy, exercise, etc. Procedures may be performed by a healthcare professional, a friend or relative 
        or in some cases by the patient themselves.

        The procedure request may represent an order that is entered by a practitioner in a CPOE system 
        as well as a proposal made by a clinical decision support (CDS) system based on a patient's clinical record 
        and context of care. Planned procedures referenced by a CarePlan may also be represented by this resource.
