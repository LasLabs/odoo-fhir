    'summary': """
        Consumption or administration of medication, vaccines, etc.""",

    'description': """
        Describes the event of a patient consuming or otherwise being administered a medication. This may be as simple as swallowing a tablet or 
        it may be a long running infusion. Related resources tie this event to the authorizing prescription, and the specific encounter between patient 
        and health care practitioner.

        **Scope and Usage**

        This resource covers the administration of all medications and vaccines. Please refer to the Immunization Resource/Profile for the treatment of vaccines. 
        It will principally be used within care settings (including inpatient) to record the capture of medication administrations, including self-administrations 
        of oral medications, injections, intra-venous adjustments, etc. It can also be used in out-patient settings to record allergy shots and other non-immunization 
        administrations. In some cases it might be used for home-health reporting, such as recording self-administered or even device-administered insulin.
