        A container for a collection of resources.

        **Scope and Usage**

        One common operation performed with resources is to gather a collection of resources into a single instance with containing context. 
        In FHIR this is referred to as "bundling" the resources together. These resource bundles are useful for a variety of different reasons, including:

        * Returning a set of resources that meet some criteria as part of a server operation (see RESTful Search)
        * Returning a set of versions of resources as part of the history operation on a server (see History)
        * Sending a set of resources as part of a message exchange (see Messaging)
        * Grouping a self-contained set of resources to act as an exchangeable and persistable collection with clinical integrity - e.g. a clinical document (see Documents)
        * Creating/updating/deleting a set of resources on a server as a single operation (including doing so as a single atomic transaction) (see Transactions)
        * Storing a collection of resources
