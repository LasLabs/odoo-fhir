        An association between a patient and an organization / healthcare provider(s) during which time encounters 
        may occur. The managing organization assumes a level of responsibility for the patient during this time.

        **Scope and Usage**

        The EpisodeOfCare Resource contains information about an association of a Patient with a Healthcare Provider 
        for a period of time under which related healthcare activities may occur.

        In many cases, this represents a period of time where the Healthcare Provider has some level of responsibility 
        for the care of the patient regarding a specific condition or problem, even if not currently participating in 
        an encounter.

        These resources are typically known in existing systems as:

        * EpisodeOfCare: Case, Program, Problem, Episode
        * Encounter: Visit, Contact
