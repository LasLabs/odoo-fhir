        The technical details of an endpoint that can be used for electronic services, such as for web services providing XDS.b or a REST endpoint for another FHIR server. 
        This may include any security context information.

        **Scope and Usage**

        An endpoint describes the technical details of a location that can be connected to for the delivery/retrieval of information. 
        Sufficient information is required to ensure that a connection can be made securely, and appropriate data transmitted as defined by the endpoint owner. 
        This is not a description of details of the current system, as found in conformance, but of another (potentially external) system.
