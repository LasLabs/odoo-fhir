    'summary': """
        A related person or animal involved in patient care but with no formal responsibility
        """,

    'description': """
        Information about a person or animal that is involved in the care for a patient, but who is not the target of healthcare, nor has a formal responsibility in the care process.

        **Scope and Usage**
        Related Persons typically have a personal or non-healthcare-specific professional relationship to the patient. A RelatedPerson resource is primarily used for attribution of information, since RelatedPersons are often a source of information about the patient. For keeping information about people for contact purposes for a patient, use a Patient's Contact element. Some individuals may serve as both a Patient's Contact and a Related Person.

        Example Related Persons are:

        * A patient's wife or husband
        * A patient's relatives or friends
        * A neighbor bringing a patient to the hospital
        * The owner or trainer of a horse
        * A patient's attorney or guardian
        * A Guide Dog
