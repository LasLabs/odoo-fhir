    **Scope and Usage**

    The GraphDefinition resource provides a formal computable definition of a graph of resources - that is, a coherent set of resources that form a graph by following references. 
    The Graph Definition resource defines a set and makes rules about the set. The GraphDefinition resource can be used to: 
    
    * Summarize a set of profiles on resources
    * Define a graph of resources to return in a query
    * Define a graph of resources to include in a document
    * Document rules about the relationship between a set of resources e.g. must all resources concern the same patient?
