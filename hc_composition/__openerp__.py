        A logical document (container) of a set of healthcare-related information
        """,

    'description': """
        A set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a single logical document that provides a single coherent statement of meaning, 
        establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to who is making the statement. While a Composition defines the structure, 
        it does not actually contain the content: rather the full content of a document is contained in a Bundle, of which the Composition is the first resource contained.

        **Scope and Usage** 
        
        A Composition is also the basic structure from which FHIR Documents - immutable bundles with attested narrative - are built. 
        A single logical composition may be associated with a series of derived documents, each of which is a frozen copy of the composition.

        Note: EN 13606 (http://www.en13606.org/) uses the term "Composition" to refer to a single commit to an EHR system, and offers some common examples: 
        a composition containing a consultation note, a progress note, a report or a letter, an investigation report, 
        a prescription form or a set of bedside nursing observations. Using Composition for an attested EHR commit is a valid uses of the Composition resource, 
        but for FHIR purposes, it would be usual to make more granular updates with individual provenance statements.
