        The Claim is intended to support:

        * Claims - where the provision of goods and services is complete and reimbursement is sought.
        * Pre-Authorization - where the provision of goods and services is proposed and either authorization and/or the reservation of funds is desired.
        * Pre-Determination - where the provision of goods and services is explored to determine what services may be covered and to what amount. Essentially a 'what if' claim.
        
        The Claim also supports:

        * Up to a 3 tier hierarchy of Goods, products, and Services, to support simple to complex billing.
        * Multiple insurance programs arranged in a Coordination of Benefit sequence to enable exchange with primary, secondary, tertiary etc. insurance coverages.
        * Assignment of benefit - the benefit may be requested to be directed to the subscriber, the provider or another party.
