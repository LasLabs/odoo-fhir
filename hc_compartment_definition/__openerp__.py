        A compartment definition that defines how resources are accessed on a server. 

        **Scope and Usage** 

        Each resource may belong to one or more logical compartments. A compartment is a logical grouping of resources which share a common property. Compartments have two principal roles: 
        
        * Function as an access mechanism for finding a set of related resources quickly
        * Provide a definitional basis for applying access control to resources quickly
