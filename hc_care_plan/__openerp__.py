        Care Plans are used in many of areas of healthcare with a variety of scopes. 
        They can be as simple as a general practitioner keeping track of when their patient is next due for a tetanus immunization 
        through to a detailed plan for an oncology patient covering diet, chemotherapy, radiation, lab work and counseling 
        with detailed timing relationships, pre-conditions and goals. They may be used in veterinary care or clinical research 
        to describe the care of a herd or other collection of animals. In public health, they may describe education or immunization campaigns.
