        **Scope and Usage** 
        
        A Goal in health care services delivery is generally an expressed desired health state to be achieved by a subject of care (or family/group) over a period or at a specific point of time. This desired target health state may be achieved as a result of health care intervention(s) or resulting from natural recovery over time. For example:

        * A goal of a plan for a condition such as a diabetes might specify desired outcome(s) (e.g. HgbA1c level =<5.6% in 3 months) 
        as a result of interventions such as medication therapy, nutritional management and/or increase physical activity.
        * A goal of a procedure might be to meet the intended objective of the procedure (e.g. wet-dry-dressing changes twice a day; 
        goal: wound healed completely in 2 weeks) or to prevent an unintended complication (e.g. repositioning a patient every two hours: 
        goal to maintain skin integrity)
