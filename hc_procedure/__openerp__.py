        **Scope and Usage**

        This resource is used to record the details of procedures performed on a patient. A procedure is an activity that is performed with or on a patient as part of the provision of care. Examples include surgical procedures, diagnostic procedures, endoscopic procedures, biopsies, counseling, physiotherapy, exercise, etc. Procedures may be performed by a healthcare professional, a friend or relative or in some cases by the patient themselves.

        This resource provides summary information about the occurrence of the procedure and is not intended to provide real-time snapshots of a procedure as it unfolds, though for long-running procedures such as psychotherapy, it could represent summary level information about overall progress. The creation of a resource to support detailed real-time procedure information awaits the identification of a specific implementation use-case to share such information.
