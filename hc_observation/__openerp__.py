        Measurements and simple assertions made about a patient, device or other subject.

        **Scope and Usage** 

        Observations are a central element in healthcare, used to support diagnosis, monitor progress, 
        determine baselines and patterns and even capture demographic characteristics. 
        Most observations are simple name/value pair assertions with some metadata, 
        but some observations group other observations together logically, or even are multi-component observations. 
        Note that the DiagnosticReport resource provides a clinical or workflow context for a set of observations.

        Uses for the Observation resource include:

        * Vital signs such as body weight, blood pressure, and temperature
        * Laboratory Data like blood glucose, or an estimated GFR
        * Imaging results like bone density or fetal measurements
        * Devices Measurements such as EKG data or Pulse Oximetry data
        * Clinical assessment tools such as APGAR or a Glasgow Coma Score
        * Personal characteristics: such as eye-color
        * Social history like tobacco use, family support, or cognitive status
        * Core characteristics like pregnancy status, or a death assertion
